## Project: Generate TV Scripts

Project for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed a deep learning model using Pytorch to generate TV scripts.

In order to complete this project, I used the GPU enabled workspaces within the Udacity classroom.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Counter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter)
- [torch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installion [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software in your browser.

### Data
The data for this project is present within the `data` folder.
